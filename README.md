# Sentiment Analysis Demo

The project, developed using Spark and Spark ML, attempts to classify the sentiment of telephone conversations from a trainline company. The telephone conversations have been translated to text prior to the analysis.

The project was originally created in Zeppelin ('Sentiment Analysis.json'), but was manually converted to a Jupyter Notebook.
